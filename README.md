# ⚡ League Voice Chat

Automatically generate **Discord voice channels for your entire LoL team** — not just your party. The app sends channel invites to teammates so everyone can join easily. 🎮🎧

🚀 **Just the client for now!**  
The server code will be released in the future. The client is preconfigured to connect to an API endpoint hosted by me :3

⚠️ **Heads up:** Only teammates running the client will get invites. Everyone needs to have it installed for full match coverage.

💾 **Download & run**  
Check the **Releases** tab for the `.exe` file — compiled with Python and all necessary libraries. Just download, run, follow the instructions, and you’re good to go! ✅
