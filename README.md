# ⚡ League Voice Chat

Automatically generate **Discord voice channels for your entire LoL team** — not just your party. The app sends channel invites to teammates so everyone can join easily. 🎮🎧

<br>

🚀 **Just the client for now!**  
The server code will be released in the future. The client is preconfigured to connect to an API endpoint hosted by me :3

⚠️ **Heads up:** Only teammates running the client will get invites. Everyone needs to have it installed for full match coverage.

💾 **Download & run**  
Check the **Releases** tab for the `.exe` file — compiled with Python and all necessary libraries. Just download, run, follow the instructions, and you’re good to go! ✅

⚠️❌ server disabled, the app is non-functional until further notice

### 📝 How to use

1. **Join the Discord server** listed in the app UI.  
2. Go to the `#tokens` channel and type `/token`. The bot will send you a DM with your **API key**.  
3. **Paste your API key** into the textbox in the app labeled **API Key** and **don't close the app**.  
4. **When you join a League match**, you will get a DM from the bot with an invite to a voice channel — and **all your teammates in that game will also get a link to the same channel if they have the app installed**. 🎧⚡
